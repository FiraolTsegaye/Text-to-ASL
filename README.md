"Bridging the Gap" presents Commusign, an offline Android app aiming to empower the hearing-impaired by removing communication barriers in healthcare and education. Its objective is to foster inclusivity through the real-time translation of voice, text, and documents into American and Ethiopian Sign Language (ASL/EthSL). The solution provides these translations via animated GIFs. Technically, it was developed using Flutter and Figma, utilizing machine learning, computer vision, and NLP to process linguistic data and generate accurate signs.
